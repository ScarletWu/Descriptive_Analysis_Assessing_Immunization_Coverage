## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data.
-   `outputs/data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, and clean data.

## LLM Statement
When I was unable to download and read the file from opendatatoronto, I sought help from ChatGPT. However, the solution provided by ChatGPT did not work, so I ultimately resolved the issue by asking a friend.
